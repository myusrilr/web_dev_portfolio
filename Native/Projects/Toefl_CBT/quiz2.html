            <h1>Question 2</h1>
            <p class="soalPanjang">[1] Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution is known as one of the most important and controversial scientific
                theories ever published. Darwin was an English scientist in the 19th century best known for his book “On the
                Origin of Species.” In his book, Darwin <span class="hightlight">postulated</span> different species shared characteristics of common ancestors, that they branched off from
                common ancestors as they evolved, and that new traits and characteristics were a result of natural
                selection. <b><u>The theory is based on the assumptions that life developed from non-life and progressed and
                    evolved in an indirect manner</u></b>. Therefore, the Theory of Evolution, while controversial, has shaped and
                influenced the modern scientific world's thinking on the development of life itself. Darwin was born
                February 12, 1809 in England. Although initially entering into medicine, Darwin chose to pursue his interest
                in natural science and embarked on a five-year journey aboard the H.M.S. Beagle, a British sloop belonging
                to the Royal Navy. Because of his experience aboard the Beagle, he laid the foundation for his Theory of
                Evolution while also establishing himself within the scientific community.
                Specifically, Darwin's keen observation of the fossils and wildlife he saw during his time on the Beagle
                served as the basis for the cornerstone of his theory: natural selection.
