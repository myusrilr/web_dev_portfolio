            <h1>Question 7</h1>
            <p class="soalPanjang">[3] Through natural selection, organisms could branch off of each other and evolve to
                the point where they no longer belong to the same species. Consequently, simple organisms evolve into
                more complex and different organisms as species break away from one another. Natural selection parallels
                selective breeding employed by humans on domesticated animals for centuries. Namely, horse breeders will
                ensure that horses with particular characteristics, such as speed and endurance, are allowed to produce
                offspring while horses that do not share those above-average traits will not. Therefore, over several
                generations, the new offspring will already be pre-disposed towards being excellent racing horses.
