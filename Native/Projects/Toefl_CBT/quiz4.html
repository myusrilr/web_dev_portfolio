            <h1>Question 4</h1>
            <p class="soalPanjang">[2] Natural selection contributes to the basis of Darwin's Theory of Evolution. One
                of the core tenets of Darwin's theory is that more offspring are always produced for a species than can
                possibly survive. Yet, no two offspring are perfectly alike. As a result, through random mutation and
                genetic drift, over time offspring develop new traits and characteristics. Over time beneficial traits
                and characteristics that promote survival will be kept in the gene pool while <span class="hightlight">those</span> that harm survival
                will be selected against. Therefore, this natural selection ensures that a species gradually improves
                itself over an extended duration of time. On the other hand, as a species continues to 'improve' itself,
                it branches out to create entirely new species that are no longer capable of reproducing together.
