            <h1>Question 12 </h1>
            <p>[4] Darwin's theory is that 'selective breeding' occurs in nature as 'natural selection' is the engine
                behind evolution. Thus, the theory provides an excellent basis for understanding how organisms change
                over time. Nevertheless, it is just a theory and elusively difficult to prove. One of the major holes in
                Darwin's theory revolves around “irreducibly complex systems.” An irreducibly complex system is known as
                a system where many different parts must all operate together. As a result, in the absence of one, the
                system as a whole collapses. Consequently, as modern technology improves, science can identify these
                “irreducibly complex systems” even at microscopic levels. These complex systems, if so inter-reliant,
                would be resistant to Darwin's supposition of how evolution occurs. As Darwin himself admitted, “To
                suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivance for adjusting the focus for different
                distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic
                aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I free confess, absurd in the highest
                degree".</p>

            <p>In <b>paragraph 4</b>, what was the author's purpose of including a quote that the belief that the
                complexity of the human eye could have been formed by natural selection seems highly unlikely?
